## What is the Kudos-o-Matic?
The Kudo project originated from the wish to create common goals for people and teams who work on different projects in order to *strengthen the team spirit*, *collectively celebrate successes* and *ensure transparency* within an organization.

The Kudos-o-Matic was created to keep track of these goals and the progress towards it. 
Users can reward each other for good deeds by giving Kudos to each other and work together to achieve common goals in the form of Kudo-thresholds.


## Quick start guide
##### Prerequisites
To start using the Kudos-o-Matic, you'll need:
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) >= 2.3.1
* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) >= 5.0.3
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) (development only)

To run the RSpec test suite (not required to run the Kudos-o-Matic), you'll need:
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)
* [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/)

##### 1. Clone the GitHub repository
With HTTPS:
```

```
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
```

##### 5. Create and setup database
```
rake db:setup

rake db:seed
```
This will add a default configuration to the database with a balance and three goals.
