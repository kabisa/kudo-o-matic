        = "in the ₭udo transaction form or by writing a ':' to see a list pop out (e.g. :wink: = \u{1F609})"

        I want to give ₭udo's but I don't know how much, are there guidelines for these cases?
      %p
        You can read the guidelines via the
        %i.fa.fa-info-circle
        button in the ₭udo transaction form. Remember that these are
        %u guidelines
        so you don't have to follow them!
